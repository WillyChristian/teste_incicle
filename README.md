# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This template was used during a selective process.

This layout was not created by me, I just recieve an image and build it.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm build`

To create an build package and upload to a server.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
